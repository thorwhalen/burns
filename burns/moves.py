"""The named camera moves, and the one resolver that expands one into a path.

A :class:`~burns.path.BurnsPath` is *resolved geometry*: rectangles measured
against one picture's pixels. That makes it the wrong thing to store when the
picture can change. What an editor wants to keep is the **authored intent** —
"push in on this, gently" — and have the rectangles computed against whatever
image is in the slot at render time. Replace the still and the move re-frames;
keep the still and the move is exactly what it was.

So this module is the vocabulary (:data:`MOVES`) plus the one function that
turns an intent into geometry (:func:`resolve_move`).

**One code path, two front doors.** ``resolve_move`` takes a *name* or an
explicit ``BurnsPath`` (or its ``to_dict()`` payload), so a caller that stores
both a named move and an optional hand-corrected path override makes one call
and the choice between them is made here — once — rather than once per consumer.
This is ``an.ir.camera.camera_keys``' arrangement: one table, not two tables
reconciled by a test.

**``seed`` replaces the ordinal, and does one job.** The motion in a sequence
used to be derived from each panel's *position* — style by ``i % 2``, zoom by
``i % 4``, push-or-pull by the parity of ``i``. Reordering one panel therefore
changed the camera on every panel after it, and "keep this move, change this
picture" was unexpressible. ``resolve_move`` is a pure function of its
arguments and never of a position; a caller mints a ``seed`` once, stores it
beside the move, and the move survives every reorder.

The seed's *only* job is choosing which concrete move ``"auto"`` becomes
(:func:`choose_move`). It deliberately does **not** perturb a named move's zoom
or framing: a named move is a decision, and a decision a seed can still nudge
is not one. Variety across a sequence comes from ``"auto"`` and from the
pictures themselves — the content-aware framing differs per image already.

    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> img = np.zeros((600, 800, 3), dtype='uint8'); img[380:520, 120:300] = 210
    >>> path = resolve_move("push_in", image=img, aspect=16 / 9, seed=41)
    >>> path.evaluate(1.0).zoom >= path.evaluate(0.0).zoom
    True
    >>> resolve_move("hold", image=img, aspect=16 / 9).evaluate(0.0) == \\
    ...     resolve_move("hold", image=img, aspect=16 / 9).evaluate(1.0)
    True

#: The identity of the resolver's *geometry*, for a caller's cache key.
#:
#: A stored panel is an intent, so the pixels it becomes depend on constants
#: that live here — :data:`DFLT_ZOOM`, :data:`DRIFT_TRAVEL`, :data:`DRIFT_SPAN`,
#: :data:`DRIFT_MIN_ROOM`, :data:`AUTO_WEIGHTS` and the order
#: :func:`choose_move` draws from. Retune any of them and an **unchanged** panel
#: renders differently.
#:
#: A consumer that caches a render keyed on the panel alone would therefore
#: serve the old frames forever, or silently produce a cut that disagrees with
#: its siblings. Put this in the key. It is ``nw.Transform.impl_version``'s
#: contract — *a lock, not a receipt*: bump it whenever the geometry changes for
#: an unchanged input, and leave it alone for a docstring or a new move name.
#:
#: Deliberately **not** the package version: a burns release that touches only
#: the renderer must not invalidate anybody's cut, and
#: ``importlib.metadata.version("burns")`` is unreliable here besides.
RESOLVER_IMPL_VERSION: int = 1

#: Default end magnification. Enough that a slow push reads as movement on a
#: 1080p frame, little enough that a found still is not visibly softened by the
#: upscale.
#:
#: A **drift** may render slightly above it: reaching :data:`DRIFT_SPAN` needs
#: :data:`DRIFT_MIN_ROOM` of travel room, which at this zoom is marginally more
#: than the window leaves, so the floor raises it to ~1.2. That is the floor
#: working, not a jitter — it is a pure function of the arguments.
DFLT_ZOOM: float = 1.18

#: How much of the available travel a drift uses, as a fraction of the room the
#: window leaves inside the image. Less than ``1.0`` on purpose: a drift that
#: runs wall to wall starts and ends against an edge, which reads as the frame
#: hitting a stop rather than as a camera continuing past the cut.
DRIFT_TRAVEL: float = 0.5

#: A ceiling on that travel, as a fraction of the **window** rather than of the
#: image — how far the camera crosses its own frame.
#:
#: Without it a drift's speed is whatever room the picture happened to leave,
#: which is not the same on both axes: on a 4:3 still delivered at 16:9 there is
#: twice as much vertical room as horizontal, so ``drift_up`` travelled ~29 % of
#: the frame where ``drift_left`` travelled ~9 % — the same named gesture at
#: three times the speed, decided by the aspect of the picture. ``an``'s camera
#: hit the same asymmetry from the other direction and answered it the same way,
#: with one fraction of the frame per axis (``an.ir.camera.PAN_FRACTION``).
#:
#: A tenth is calibrated against what the room-limited horizontal case already
#: produces at :data:`DFLT_ZOOM`, and against ``ken_burns_path(style="drift")``'s
#: ~7 %: legible at 1080p over a normal panel, and not a whip.
DRIFT_SPAN: float = 0.10

#: The least travel room a drift will accept, in image units. When the
#: requested ``zoom`` leaves less, the zoom is *raised* until it does — the same
#: way ``content_aware_path``'s ``min_zoom`` floor wins over its framing cap.
#: A drift with no room is a hold, and silently returning one is the failure
#: this floor exists to prevent.
#:
#: **It is derived, not chosen**, and the derivation is the point. Travel is
#: ``min(room * DRIFT_TRAVEL, size * DRIFT_SPAN)`` with ``size == 1 - room``, so
#: the span can only ever bind when
#: ``room >= DRIFT_SPAN / (DRIFT_TRAVEL + DRIFT_SPAN)`` — one sixth, at the
#: values above. Set below that and the two constants can *never* both bind:
#: the floor silently wins everywhere, every room-limited drift crosses
#: ``DRIFT_TRAVEL * DRIFT_MIN_ROOM / (1 - DRIFT_MIN_ROOM)`` of its frame, and
#: :data:`DRIFT_SPAN`'s promise that the two axes read at the same speed holds
#: only on pictures with room to spare. At ``0.08`` it measured 2.3x apart on a
#: portrait still delivered at 16:9 — the exact asymmetry DRIFT_SPAN exists to
#: remove. ``tests/test_moves.py`` pins the relationship, so changing either
#: constant without the other fails.
DRIFT_MIN_ROOM: float = DRIFT_SPAN / (DRIFT_TRAVEL + DRIFT_SPAN)

#: Slack when comparing a stored path's ``output_aspect`` against the render's.
#: **Relative**, not absolute: an absolute tolerance on a ratio is four times
#: stricter for 2.39:1 scope than for a 9:16 vertical, which is not a judgement
#: anybody made. It exists only to absorb float noise between two spellings of
#: the same shape (``1920 / 1080`` against ``16 / 9``), never to let a genuinely
#: different delivery through.

            are the two front doors on this one path: a stored panel that
            carries both a named move and a hand-corrected override passes the
            override here and the choice is made in one place.
        image: the still the move is framed against — a path, ``PIL.Image`` or
            ndarray. **Required, and read every time**: the framing depends on
            what is in the picture, so swapping the still must re-frame. Do not
            cache the returned path against the intent.
        aspect: the delivered ``width / height``. ``None`` means "match the
            image". Required rather than defaulted, because a cut has a
            delivery size and quietly framing for the image's aspect instead is
            a cover-crop nobody asked for.
        zoom: the end magnification. A pure function of the arguments — never
            jittered by ``seed`` or by a position — but **bounded at both
            ends**, so the number you pass is a request:

            * capped so the padded keep-region stays framed. A subject filling
              the frame therefore yields a nearly static move; the fix is a
              tighter ``focus``, not a bigger ``zoom``.
            * floored. ``push_in`` / ``pull_out`` inherit
              ``content_aware_path``'s ``min_zoom + 0.02`` (about 1.07), so a
              barely-there 1.02 push renders as 1.07; ``hold`` has no such floor
              and honours 1.02 exactly. A drift is floored to whatever leaves
              :data:`DRIFT_MIN_ROOM` of travel.
        focus: an explicit keep-region overriding the saliency estimate. A
            :class:`~burns.rect.Rect`, a normalized ``(x, y, w, h)`` tuple, or
            any object with ``.x/.y/.w/.h``. When given,
            :func:`~burns.content.salient_box` is not called at all.
        seed: chooses which move ``"auto"`` becomes, and nothing else. Mint it
            once per panel and store it; never derive it from a position, which
            is the defect this parameter exists to remove.
        easing: CSS timing function or callable. A callable is fine here but
            cannot be serialized — see :meth:`BurnsPath.to_dict`. Applies to a
            named move; an explicit path carries its own.
        on_aspect_mismatch: what to do when an explicit path was authored for a
            different ``output_aspect`` than the one being rendered.
            ``"raise"`` (default) refuses, because honouring the stored
            rectangles at another shape cover-crops a framing somebody chose by
            hand. ``"refit"`` rebuilds each keyframe at the new aspect,
            **keeping what the author actually chose** — where the camera looks
            at each instant, and how far in it is — and changing only the window
            shape. A cut in a second aspect is a real workflow (a vertical
            edit of a landscape film), and a panel carries *one* path, not one
            per delivery, so "author a second path" is not a remedy a caller
            can take; ``"refit"`` is.

    Returns:
        A :class:`~burns.path.BurnsPath`. Duration is not part of it; pass that
        to the renderer.

    Raises:
        MoveError: an unknown move name, a malformed ``focus``, a non-positive
            ``zoom`` or ``aspect``, or — under the default
            ``on_aspect_mismatch="raise"`` — an explicit path whose
            ``output_aspect`` contradicts ``aspect``.

        ``image`` is opened for every *named* move. For an explicit path it is
        read only when refitting, since resolved geometry needs no picture.

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> img = np.zeros((600, 800, 3), dtype='uint8'); img[300:460, 500:700] = 230

        A named move is a decision, so the seed does not touch it:

        >>> resolve_move("push_in", image=img, aspect=16 / 9, seed=1) == \\
        ...     resolve_move("push_in", image=img, aspect=16 / 9, seed=999)
        True

        ``"auto"`` is where the seed does its one job:

        >>> a = resolve_move("auto", image=img, aspect=16 / 9, seed=3)
        >>> a == resolve_move("auto", image=img, aspect=16 / 9, seed=3)
        True

        A drift travels — and ``drift_right`` ends further right:

        >>> d = resolve_move("drift_right", image=img, aspect=16 / 9)
        >>> d.evaluate(1.0).x > d.evaluate(0.0).x
        True

        An explicit path is the other front door, returned as authored:

        >>> from burns import BurnsPath, Rect
        >>> hand = BurnsPath.from_start_end(
        ...     Rect(0, 0, 1, 1), Rect(0.1, 0.1, 0.6, 0.6), output_aspect=16 / 9
        ... )
        >>> resolve_move(hand.to_dict(), image=img, aspect=16 / 9) == hand
        True

        Rendering it at another delivery refuses by default, and ``"refit"``
        keeps the authored look while changing the window shape:

        >>> resolve_move(hand, image=img, aspect=9 / 16)
        Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
        burns.moves.MoveError: ...
        >>> v = resolve_move(hand, image=img, aspect=9 / 16,
        ...                  on_aspect_mismatch="refit")
        >>> v.output_aspect == 9 / 16
        True
        >>> before = [round(c, 4) for c in hand.evaluate(1.0).center]
        >>> after = [round(c, 4) for c in v.evaluate(1.0).center]
        >>> before == after          # the author's framing, at the new shape
        True
