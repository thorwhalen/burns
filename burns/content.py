"""Content-aware Ken Burns: choose crop windows that keep the subject (and any
detected faces) framed, and avoid drifting over empty regions like sky.

Two layers, usable together or apart:

* :func:`salient_box` — a **zero-dependency** (numpy + Pillow, already required)
  estimate of the busy / high-detail region of an image, so motion follows the
  subject instead of blank sky or plain ground. Good default when you have no
  detector.
* :func:`content_aware_path` — the **pure geometry**: given the image size and a
  *keep-region* (the union of face boxes if any, else a subject box), build a
  :class:`~burns.path.BurnsPath` whose start/end windows keep that region fully
  framed while zooming toward or away from it. This is the reusable, testable
  core; it touches no pixels.

Detection is **injected**, not built in: faces come from a caller-supplied
``faces_detector`` (an LLM, an ONNX/cv2 model, or manual boxes), so this module
stays dependency-light and deterministic. Boxes everywhere are normalized
``(x, y, w, h)`` in ``[0, 1]`` with a top-left origin — the same convention as
:class:`~burns.rect.Rect`.

The geometry :func:`content_aware_path` is built from is exported rather than
inlined — :func:`axis_maxima`, :func:`keep_window`, :func:`fit_zoom` and
:func:`pad_box`. :mod:`burns.moves` builds its static and drift moves out of the
same four, so "a window of this zoom, at this output aspect, centred here" has
one implementation rather than one per move.
