"""Golden-vector conformance test — the cross-language equivalence contract.

``tests/golden/vectors.json`` pins, from the Python implementation, the two
things a second-language renderer (the future ``kenburnz`` TS/npm port) must
reproduce exactly:

1. ``evaluate``  — ``(spec, t) -> Rect{x, y, w, h}``, the pure motion math.
2. ``pixel_box`` — ``(spec, image_size, output_size, t) -> [x0, y0, x1, y1]``,
   the integer crop box :func:`burns._frame.sample_box` reads (the highest
   cross-language risk: evaluate -> clamp -> to_pixels -> cover-crop).

The fixture is the source of truth; this test asserts the **live** code still
matches it. Regenerate it deliberately with ``python misc/gen_golden_vectors.py``
when (and only when) an intended change to the spec math lands — an *unintended*
change makes this test fail instead of silently rewriting the contract.

Rects compare within the fixture's ``eps``; pixel boxes compare as exact ints.
